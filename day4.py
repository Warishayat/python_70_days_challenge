#in 4/70 day of challenge i will cover the bsic of operaotrs there are diffrent type o opreator>
#like addition (+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),modulus(%),exponential (**) and floor division(//)

n1=int(input("Enter the first number:- "))
n2=int(input("Enter the second number:- "))
print("The Addition of these two number is: ",n1+n2)
print("The Subtraction of these two number is: ",n1-n2)
print("The Division of these two number is: ",n1/n2)
print("The Multiplication of these two number is: ",n1*n2)
print("The Modulus  of these two number is: ",n1%n2)
print("The exponential of these two number is: ",n1**n2)
print("The floor division of these two number is: ",n1//n2)

#Assignment operator
i=6
j=10
print(" ",i,j)
j*=i
print(" ",i,j)

#comparision operator 
n11=4
n22=5
if n1==n22:
    print("Number are same:-")
else:
    print("Number are not same:-")

n13=4
n25=5
is_flag=True
if n13!=n25:
    True
else:
    False

##logical operators AND (All shoud be true) or (atleast one shoukd be true) not (reverse the result if result is true it will gave us false)
