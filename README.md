# python_70_days_challenge
In these 75 days python programming challenge I will start cover all the basic and advance level concepts. we also try to solve basic problems.
<br>
----->Day 1/70  first day of challenge i simply setup my vs code and i print a simple code print(hello world) which is quite basic.
<br>
----->Day 2/70 i cover the basic variable each and every thing related to thevariable.
<br>
----->Day 3/70 i cover the diffrent data types like ascii int value float value string value,mapping,sequence,data set and numeric data types.
<br>
----->Day 4/70 i cover the basic of operaotrs there are diffrent type o opreator
like addition (+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),modulus(%),exponential (**) and floor division(//). and solve some basic example.
<br>
----->Day 5/70 i cover the logical operator like and or and not operator then i go in deep like identity operator (is and is not ) operator if all the variable are same and vice versa.than i cover the membership operator  (in operator and not in) return true if the value is present is sequence and vice versa for not in than i cover bitwise opreator like 0 and 1 is bit and its called binary number system.i cover (&, |,  and xor ) in bitwise after that i simply take the concept of opreator precedence if there are many operator which will precede first we will follow 
BODMAS Rule (Bracket open than division,than multipication,than addition and than subtraction).
<br>
----->Day 6/70 of challenge and today i will try to cover the loops and control statments
More over i will also try to solve the question of conditions and loops and i wil  try to push all these thing to github for the other people and student as well.
i try  the concept of conditional statments like if, else if ,nested,ternary ,else if ladder, and  switch.i take the disicion on the basis of the control statments
<br>
----->Day 7/70 i will cover the Elif contol statment.and  i solve the problem.
<br>
----->Day 8/70 challenge and i will cover the multiple condition using logical operator like AND or "or" OERATOR.Logical operator help us to combining the elemnt of two elements. and i will solve the problem.
<br>
----->Day 9/70 --> Nested if else: for complex disicon making:a statment with in statment
Question: Write a program that take the total purchase amount as input and output the corresponding discount percentage:
#100$ ----> 20% discount
#55 to 99$ ------>10%
#below------>No discoun
#dO Same code which i laready had done in python day 8. now do it wirth nested if else>
<br>
----->Day 10/70 challenge we cover the match case. 
<br>
----->Day 11/70 we cover the ternary operaot. is sum the code with in a line.
<br>
----->Day 12/70 i will cover the loop>
we have two type of loop for loop and while loop. FOR is a pre built key Then we initialized a variable then in range mean what will be range of n start to end 
e.g = for i in range( 1(start),10(end),1(move forward by 1)) it will work 1 to 9.
<br>
---->13/70 i  cover the for loop with some pattren 
<br>
---->14/70 i cover the break and continue statments.
<br>
---->15/70 i cover the basic of function how to make function and how i can pass value through arguments etc.
<br>
---->16/70 we cover the basic of functions arguments like positional arguments,default arguments and variable length arguments.
<br>
----->17/70 we cover the basisc of the list like what is list how to concate list and some more basic things.
<br>
----->18/70 we cover the methods of the list and solve some example.
<br>
----->19/70 we cover the concept of tuple which is unmuteable and all things
